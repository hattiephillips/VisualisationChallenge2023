Hello and welcome to the Visualisation Challenge 2023!

Here you can find the question and the data. 

Please find all the contacts and the information for submission on your home systems.

#  The Question:

What impact has seasonal change had on shipping in the Arctic between 2015-2022 and what are the predictions for the future?

Please answer a minimum of 2 sub questions:
1. What are the historic changes to traffic lanes/routes over the seasons?
2. What is the average time taken to complete a route and have ice limits changed this?
3. Are there any patterns evident of when a separate/additional ice breaker is required for vessels conducting the transit?
4. What evidence of warship movements can be obtained from AIS data alone?
