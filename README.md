# VisualisationChallenge2023

Hello and welcome to the Visualisation Challenge 2023!

Here you can find the question and the data. 

Please find all the contacts and the information for submission on your home systems.

#  The Question:

What impact has seasonal change had on shipping in the Arctic between 2015-2022 and what are the predictions for the future?

Please answer a minimum of 2 sub questions:
1. What are the historic changes to traffic lanes/routes over the seasons?
2. What is the average time taken to complete a route and have ice limits changed this?
3. Are there any patterns evident of when a separate/additional ice breaker is required for vessels conducting the transit?
4. What evidence of warship movements can be obtained from AIS data alone?

#  The Data:

Some small caveats on the new data:

-The MMSI in real data has actual meaning (like some digits are a country code). The MMSIs in this are just random numbers.  Donâ€™t listen to them.

-The data has been resampled to the 3hr samples.  It is not representative of the output of a transponder, it is something a commercial provider might do before giving it to you.


-The fake data simulated very, very cleaned and filtered data without fishing vessels, without vessels of unknown type.


-The data has been clipped to the areas generally regarded as prone to ice danger.


-The ship names are taken from a list of ship names on Wikipedia.
